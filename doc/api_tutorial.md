[Source code :fontawesome-brands-github:](https://github.com/remicres/otbtf/tree/master/otbtf/examples/tensorflow_v2x/fcnn){ .md-button }

This section covers the use of the Python API with deep learnig models.
It shows how to build and train a small fully convolutional model from patches 
extracted in the images. The example shows how a model can be trained (1) from 
**patches-images**, or (2) from **TFRecords** files.

## Classes and files

- **fcnn_model.py** implements a small fully convolutional U-Net like model,
called `FCNNModel`, with the preprocessing and normalization functions that
inherit from `otbtf.BaseModel`
- **train_from_patches-images.py** shows how to train the model from a list of
patches-images
- **train_from_tfrecords.py** shows how to train the model from TFRecords files
- **create_tfrecords.py** shows how to convert patch-images into TFRecords
files
- **helper.py** contains a few helping functions

## Datasets

Tensorflow datasets are the most practical way to feed a network data during
training steps.
In particular, they are very useful to train models with data parallelism using
multiple workers (i.e. multiple GPU devices).
Since OTBTF 3, two kind of approaches are available to deliver the patches:

- Create TF datasets from **patches-images**: the first approach implemented in
OTBTF, relying on geospatial raster formats supported by GDAL. Patches are
stacked in rows. patches-images are friendly because they can be visualized
like any other image. However this approach is **not very optimized**, since it
generates a lot of I/O and stresses the filesystem when iterating randomly over
patches.
- Create TF datasets from **TFRecords** files. The principle is that a number of
patches are stored in TFRecords files (google protobuf serialized data). This
approach provides the best performances, since it generates less I/Os since
multiple patches are read simultaneously together. It is the recommended approach
to work on high end gear. It requires an additional step of converting the
patches-images into TFRecords files.

### Patches-images based datasets

**Patches-images** are generated from the `PatchesExtraction` application of OTBTF.
They consist in extracted patches stacked in rows into geospatial rasters.
The `otbtf.DatasetFromPatchesImages` provides access to **patches-images** as a
TF dataset. It inherits from the `otbtf.Dataset` class, which can be a base class
to develop other raster based datasets.
The `use_streaming` option can be used to read the patches on-the-fly
on the filesystem. However, this can cause I/O bottleneck when one training step
is shorter that fetching one batch of data. Typically, this is very common with
small networks trained over large amount of data using multiple GPUs, causing the
filesystem read operation being the weak point (and the GPUs wait for the batches
to be ready). The class offers other functionalities, for instance changing the
iterator class with a custom one (can inherit from `otbtf.dataset.IteratorBase`)
which is, by default, an `otbtf.dataset.RandomIterator`. This could enable to
control how the patches are walked, from the multiple patches-images of the
dataset.

Suppose you have extracted some patches with the `PatchesExtraction`
application with 2 sources:

 - Source "xs": patches images *xs_1.tif*, ..., *xs_N.tif*
 - Source "labels": patches images *labels_1.tif*, ..., *labels_N.tif*

To create a dataset from this set of patches can be done with
`otbtf.DatasetFromPatchesImages` as shown below.

```python
dataset = DatasetFromPatchesImages(
    filenames_dict={
        "input_xs_patches": ["xs_1.tif", ..., "xs_N.tif"],
        "labels_patches": ["labels_1.tif", ..., "labels_N.tif"]
    }
)
```

Getting the Tensorflow dataset is done doing:

```python
tf_dataset = dataset.get_tf_dataset(
    batch_size=8,
    targets_keys=["predictions"]
)
```

Here the `targets_keys` list contains all the keys of the target tensors.
We will explain later why this has to be specified.

You can also convert the dataset into TFRecords files:

```python
tf_dataset.to_tfrecords(output_dir="/tmp/")
```

TFRecords are the subject of the next section!

### TFRecords batches datasets

**TFRecord** based datasets are implemented in the `otbtf.tfrecords` module.
They basically deliver patches from the TFRecords files, which can be created
with the `to_tfrecords()` method of the `otbtf.Dataset` based classes.
Depending on the filesystem characteristics and the computational cost of one
training step, it can be good to select the number of samples per TFRecords file.
Another tweak is the shuffling: since one TFRecord file contains multiple patches,
the way TFRecords files are accessed (sometimes, we need them to be randomly
accessed), and the way patches are accessed (within a buffer, of size set with
the `shuffle_buffer_size`), is crucial.

Creating TFRecords based datasets is super easy:

```python
dataset = TFRecords("/tmp")
tf_dataset = dataset.read(
    shuffle_buffer_size=1000,
    batch_size=8,
    target_keys=["predictions"]
)
```

## Model

### Overview

Let's define the setting for our model:

```python
# Number of classes estimated by the model
N_CLASSES = 2

# Name of the input
INPUT_NAME = "input_xs"

# Name of the target output
TARGET_NAME = "predictions"

# Name (prefix) of the output we will use at inference time
OUTPUT_SOFTMAX_NAME = "predictions_softmax_tensor"
```

Our model estimates *2* classes. The input name is *input_xs*, and the
target output is *predictions*. This target output will be used to compute 
the loss value, which is used ultimately to drive the learning of the 
network. The name of the output that we want to use at inference time is
*predictions_softmax_tensor*. We won't use this tensor for anything else than
inference.

To build our model, we can build from scratch building on `tf.keras.Model`, 
but we will see how OTBTF helps a lot with the `otbtf.BaseModel` class.
First, let's take a look to this schema:

![modelbase](images/modelbase.png)

As we can see, we can distinguish two main functional blocks:

- training
- inference

### Dataset transformation

During training, we need to preprocess the samples generated by the dataset to
feed the network and the loss computation, that will guide how weights will be
updated. This **data transformation** is generally required to put the data
in the format expected by the model.

![modelbase2](images/modelbase_2.png)

In our example, the terrain truth consists in labels which are integer values
ranging from 0 to 1. However, the loss function that computes the cross
entropy expects one hot encoding. The first thing to do is hence to transform
the labels values into a one hot vector:

```python
def dataset_preprocessing_fn(examples: dict):
    return {
        INPUT_NAME: examples["input_xs_patches"],
        TARGET_NAME: tf.one_hot(
            tf.squeeze(tf.cast(examples["labels_patches"], tf.int32), axis=-1),
            depth=N_CLASSES
        )
    }
```

As you can see, we don't modify the input tensor, since we want to use it 
as it in the model.
Note that since version 4.2.0 the `otbtf.ops.one_hot` can ease the transform:

```python
def dataset_preprocessing_fn(examples: dict):
    return {
        INPUT_NAME: examples["input_xs_patches"],
        TARGET_NAME: otbtf.ops.one_hot(
            labels=examples["labels_patches"],
            nb_classes=N_CLASSES
        )
}

```

### Model inputs preprocessing

The model is intended to work on real world images, which have often 16 bits
signed integers as pixel values. The model has to normalize these values such
as they fit the [0, 1] range before applying the convolutions. This is called
**normalization**.

![modelbase1](images/modelbase_1.png)

This is the purpose of `normalize_inputs()`, which has to be implemented as
model method. The method inputs a dictionary of tensors, and returns a
dictionary of normalized tensors. The transformation is done multiplying the
input by 0.0001, which guarantee that the 12-bits encoded Spot-7 image pixels
is in the [0, 1] range. Also, we cast the input tensor, which is originally of
type integer, to floating point.

```python
class FCNNModel(ModelBase):
    def normalize_inputs(self, inputs: dict):
        return {INPUT_NAME: tf.cast(inputs[INPUT_NAME], tf.float32) * 0.0001}
```

### Network implementation

Then we implement the model itself in `FCNNModel.get_outputs()`. The model
must return a dictionary of tensors. All keys of the target tensors must be in 
the returned dictionary (in our case: the *predictions* tensor). These target 
keys will be used later by the optimizer to perform the optimization of the 
loss.

![modelbase3](images/modelbase_3.png)

Our model is built with an encoder composed of 4 downscaling convolutional
blocks, and its mirrored reversed decoder with skip connections between the
layers of same scale. The last layer is a softmax layer that estimates the
probability distribution for each class, and its output is used to perform the
computation of the cross entropy loss with the terrain truth one hot encoded
labels. Its name is *predictions* so that the loss crosses the terrain truth
and the estimated values.

```python
...
    def get_outputs(self, normalized_inputs: dict) -> dict:

        def _conv(inp, depth, name):
            conv_op = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(
                filters=depth,
                kernel_size=3,
                strides=2,
                activation="relu",
                padding="same",
                name=name
            )
            return conv_op(inp)

        def _tconv(inp, depth, name, activation="relu"):
            tconv_op = tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(
                filters=depth,
                kernel_size=3,
                strides=2,
                activation=activation,
                padding="same",
                name=name
            )
            return tconv_op(inp)

        out_conv1 = _conv(normalized_inputs[INPUT_NAME], 16, "conv1")
        out_conv2 = _conv(out_conv1, 32, "conv2")
        out_conv3 = _conv(out_conv2, 64, "conv3")
        out_conv4 = _conv(out_conv3, 64, "conv4")
        out_tconv1 = _tconv(out_conv4, 64, "tconv1") + out_conv3
        out_tconv2 = _tconv(out_tconv1, 32, "tconv2") + out_conv2
        out_tconv3 = _tconv(out_tconv2, 16, "tconv3") + out_conv1
        predictions = _tconv(out_tconv3, N_CLASSES, OUTPUT_SOFTMAX_NAME, "softmax")

        return {TARGET_NAME: predictions}

```

Now our model is complete.

## Training, validation, and test

In the following, we will use the Keras API using the `model.compile()` then
`model.fit()` instructions.

First we declare the strategy used. Here we chose 
`tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` which enable to use multiple GPUs on one 
computing resource.

```python
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
```

Then we instantiate, compile, and train the model within the `strategy` scope.

First, we create an instance of our model:

```python
with strategy.scope():
    model = FCNNModel(dataset_element_spec=ds_train.element_spec)
```

In all the following, we are still inside the `strategy` scope.
After the model is instantiated, we compile it using:

- a `tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy` loss, that will compute the
categorical cross-entropy between the target labels (delivered from the 
pre-processed dataset) and the target output returned from `get_output()` of 
our model
- an Adam optimizer,
- Precision and Recall metrics (respectively `tf.keras.metrics.Precision` and
`tf.keras.metrics.Recall`), that will be later computed over the validation
dataset

```python
    model.compile(
        loss=tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(),
        optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-4),
        metrics=[tf.keras.metrics.Precision(), tf.keras.metrics.Recall()]
    )
```

We can then train our model using Keras:

```python
    model.fit(ds_train, epochs=100, validation_data=ds_valid)
```

At the end of the training (here we just perform 100 epochs over the training
dataset, then stop), we could perform some evaluation over an additional test
dataset:

```python
    model.evaluate(ds_test, batch_size=64)
```

Finally we can save our model as a SavedModel: 

```python
    model.save("/tmp/my_1st_savedmodel")
```

## Inference

This section show how to apply the fully convolutional model over an entire 
image. 

### Postprocessing to avoid blocking artifacts

The class `otbtf.ModelBase` provides the necessary to enable fully
convolutional models to be applied over large images, avoiding blocking 
artifacts caused by convolutions at the borders of tensors.
`ModelBase` comes with a `postprocess_outputs()`, that process the outputs 
tensors returned by `get_outputs()`. This creates new outputs, aiming to be 
used at inference time. The default implementation of 
`ModelBase.postprocess_outputs()` avoids blocking artifacts, by keeping 
only the values of the central part of the tensors in spatial dimensions (you
can read more on the subject in this 
[book](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003020851)).

If you take a look to 
[`ModelBase.__init__()`](reference/otbtf/model.html#otbtf.model.ModelBase.__init__)
you can notice the `inference_cropping` parameter, with the default values 
set to [16, 32, 64, 96, 128]. Now if you take another look in  
[`ModelBase.postprocess_outputs()`](reference/otbtf/model.html#otbtf.model.ModelBase.postprocess_outputs),
you can see how these values are used: the model will create an array of 
outputs, each one cropped to one value of `inference_cropping`. These cropped 
outputs enable to avoid or lower the magnitude of the blocking artifacts 
in convolutional models.
The new outputs tensors are named by the
[`cropped_tensor_name()`](reference/otbtf/model.html#otbtf.model.cropped_tensor_name)
function, that returns a new name corresponding to:
```python
f"{tensor_name}_crop{crop}"
```
For instance, for the new output tensor created for *predictions*, that 
removes 32 pixels from the borders in the spatial dimensions, would be named
***predictions_crop32***.

### How to choose the right cropping value?

Theoretically, we can determine the part of the output image that is not 
polluted by the convolutional padding. 
For a 2D convolution of stride \(s\) and kernel size \(k\), we can deduce the 
valid output size \(y\) from input size \(x\) using this expression:
$$
y = \left[\frac{x - k }{s}\right] + 1
$$
For a 2D transposed convolution of stride \(s\) and kernel size \(k\), we can 
deduce the valid output size \(y\) from input size \(x\) using this expression:
$$
y = x * s - k + 2
$$

Let's consider a chunk of input image of size 64, and check the valid output 
size of our model:

| Conv. name     | Conv. type        | Kernel | Stride | Out. size | Valid out. size |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| *input*        | /                 | /      | /      | 64        | 64              |
| *conv1*        | Conv2D            | 3      | 2      | 32        | 31              |
| *conv2*        | Conv2D            | 3      | 2      | 16        | 15              |
| *conv3*        | Conv2D            | 3      | 2      | 8         | 7               |
| *conv4*        | Conv2D            | 3      | 2      | 4         | 3               |
| *tconv1*       | Transposed Conv2D | 3      | 2      | 8         | 5               |
| *tconv2*       | Transposed Conv2D | 3      | 2      | 16        | 9               |
| *tconv3*       | Transposed Conv2D | 3      | 2      | 32        | 17              |
| *classifier*   | Transposed Conv2D | 3      | 2      | 64        | 33              |

This shows that our model can be applied in a fully convolutional fashion 
without generating blocking artifacts, using the central part of the output of 
size 33. This is equivalent to remove \((64 - 33)/2 = 15\) pixels from 
the borders of the output. We keep the upper nearest power of 2 to keep the 
convolutions consistent between two adjacent image chunks, hence we can remove 16 
pixels from the borders. We can hence use the output cropped with **16** pixels, 
named ***predictions_crop16*** in the model outputs.
By default, cropped outputs in `otbtf.ModelBase` are generated for the following 
values: `[16, 32, 64, 96, 128]` but that can be changed setting `inference_cropping` 
in the model `__init__()` (see the reference API documentation for details).

!!! Info

    Very deep networks will lead to very large cropping values.
    In these cases, there is a tradeoff between numerical 
    exactness VS computational cost. In practice, expression field can be 
    ridiculously enlarged since most of the networks learn to disminish the
    convolutional distortion at the border of the training patches.

### TensorflowModelServe parameters

We can use the exported SavedModel, located in */tmp/my_1st_savedmodel*, using
either:

- The OTB command line interface,
- The OTB Python wrapper,
- The PyOTB Python wrapper,
- The OTB Graphical User Interface,
- QGIS (you have to copy the descriptors of OTBTF applications in QGIS 
configuration folder).
In the following, we focus only the CLI and python.

In the following subsections, we run `TensorflowModelServe` over the input 
image, with the following parameters:

- the input name is ***input_xs***
- the output name is ***predictions_crop16*** (cropping margin of 16 pixels)
- we choose a receptive field of ***64*** and an expression field of 
***32*** so that they match the cropping margin of 16 pixels (since we remove 
16 pixels from each side in x and y dimensions, we remove a total of 32 pixels 
from each borders in x/y dimensions). 

### Command Line Interface

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```commandline
otbcli_TensorflowModelServe \
-source1.il $DATADIR/fake_spot6.jp2 \
-source1.rfieldx 64 \ 
-source1.rfieldy 64 \
-source1.placeholder "input_xs" \
-model.dir /tmp/my_1st_savedmodel \
-model.fullyconv on \
-output.names "predictions_crop16" \
-output.efieldx 32 \
-output.efieldy 32 \
-out softmax.tif
```

### OTB Python wrapper

The previous command translates in the following in python, using the OTB 
python wrapper:

```python
import otbApplication
app = otbApplication.Registry.CreateApplication("TensorflowModelServe")
app.SetParameterStringList("source1.il", ["fake_spot6.jp2"])
app.SetParameterInt("source1.rfieldx", 64)
app.SetParameterInt("source1.rfieldy", 64)
app.SetParameterString("source1.placeholder", "input_xs")
app.SetParameterString("model.dir", "/tmp/my_1st_savedmodel")
app.EnableParameter("fullyconv")
app.SetParameterStringList("output.names", ["predictions_crop16"])
app.SetParameterInt("output.efieldx", 32)
app.SetParameterInt("output.efieldy", 32)
app.SetParameterString("out", "softmax.tif")
app.ExecuteAndWriteOutput()
```

### PyOTB

Using PyOTB is nicer:

```python
import pyotb
pyotb.TensorflowModelServe({
    "source1.il": "fake_spot6.jp2",
    "source1.rfieldx": 64,
    "source1.rfieldy": 64,
    "source1.placeholder": "input_xs",
    "model.dir": "/tmp/my_1st_savedmodel",
    "fullyconv": True,
    "output.names": ["predictions_crop16"],
    "output.efieldx": 32,
    "output.efieldy": 32,
    "out": "softmax.tif",
})
```

!!! Note

    The processing can be optimized using the `optim` parameters group.
    In a terminal, type `otbcli_TensorflowModelServe --help optim` for more
    information. Also, the extended filenames of the orfeo toolbox enables to 
    control the output image chunk size and tiling/stripping layout. Combined 
    with the `optim` parameters, you will likely always find the best settings 
    suited for the hardware. Also, the receptive and expression fields sizes 
    have a major contribution.
