This remote module of the [Orfeo ToolBox](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org) provides a generic, multi purpose deep learning framework, targeting remote sensing images processing.
It contains a set of new process objects that internally invoke [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and a bunch of user-oriented applications to perform deep learning with real-world remote sensing images.
Applications can be used to build OTB pipelines from Python or C++ APIs. 

## Features

### OTB Applications

- Sample patches in remote sensing images with `PatchesExtraction`,
- Model training, supporting save/restore/import operations (a model can be trained from scratch or fine-tuned) with `TensorflowModelTrain`,
- Inference with support of OTB streaming mechanism with `TensorflowModelServe`. The streaming mechanism means (1) no limitation with images sizes, (2) inference can be used as a "lego" in any OTB pipeline (using C++ or Python APIs) and preserving streaming, (3) MPI support available (use multiple processing unit to generate one single output image)

### Python

The `otbtf` module targets python developers that want to train their own model from python with TensorFlow or Keras.
It provides various classes for datasets and iterators to handle the _patches images_ generated from the `PatchesExtraction` OTB application.
For instance, the `otbtf.DatasetFromPatchesImages` can be instantiated from a set of _patches images_
and delivering samples as `tf.dataset` that can be used in your favorite TensorFlow pipelines, or convert your patches into TFRecords.
The `otbtf.TFRecords` enables you train networks from TFRecords files, which is quite suited for 
distributed training. Read more in the [tutorial for keras](otbtf/examples/tensorflow_v2x/fcnn/README.md).

`tricks.py` is here for backward compatibility with codes based on OTBTF 1.x and 2.x.

## Examples

Below are some screen captures of deep learning applications performed at large scale with OTBTF.
 - Landcover mapping (Spot-7 images --> Building map using semantic segmentation)

 - Super resolution (Sentinel-2 images upsampled with the [SR4RS software](https://github.com/remicres/sr4rs), which is based on OTBTF)

 - Sentinel-2 reconstruction with Sentinel-1 VV/VH with the [Decloud software](https://github.com/CNES/decloud), which is based on OTBTF

 - Image to image translation (Spot-7 image --> Wikimedia Map using CGAN. So unnecessary but fun!)

## How to install

For now you have two options: either use the existing **docker image**, or build everything **from source**.

### Docker

Use the latest CPU or GPU-enabled image from dockerhub:
```
docker run mdl4eo/otbtf:3.3.2-cpu otbcli_PatchesExtraction -help
```

Read more in the [docker use documentation](doc/DOCKERUSE.md).

### Build from sources

Read more in the [build from sources documentation](doc/HOWTOBUILD.md).

## How to use

- Reading [the applications documentation](doc/APPLICATIONS.md) will help, of course ðŸ˜‰
- A small [tutorial](https://mdl4eo.irstea.fr/2019/01/04/an-introduction-to-deep-learning-on-remote-sensing-images-tutorial/) on MDL4EO's blog
- in the `python` folder are provided some [ready-to-use deep networks, with documentation and scientific references](doc/EXAMPLES.md).
- A [book](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003020851): *Cresson, R. (2020). Deep Learning for Remote Sensing Images with Open Source Software. CRC Press.* Use QGIS, OTB and Tensorflow to perform various kind of deep learning sorcery on remote sensing images (patch-based classification for landcover mapping, semantic segmentation of buildings, optical image restoration from joint SAR/Optical time series).
- Check [our repository](https://github.com/remicres/otbtf_tutorials_resources) containing stuff (data and models) to begin with with!
- Finally, take a look in the `test` folder. You will find plenty of command lines for applications tests!
